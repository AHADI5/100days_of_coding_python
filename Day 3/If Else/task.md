### Condition Check
Learn to use conditionals in Python to check a conditions and tell the computer what to do in each case. 
e.g.

`if <this condition is true>:`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`<then execute this line of code>`

### What if the condition is false?
The else keyword is used to define a block of code that will execute if the condition checked in the if statement is false.

`if pigs can fly:`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`<Some code that will never execute>`

`else:`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print("This is real life")`

### Python Indentation
Understand the importance of indentation in Python as a way to make certain lines of code subsidaries of other lines of code.

e.g.

`if 5 > 2: #This is a parent line of code`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print("yes") #this is a child line of code`
