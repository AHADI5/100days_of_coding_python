The first step of solving a problem is being able to describe the problem.

### PAUSE 1 
Look at the code in task.py and answer the following questions:
1. What is the for loop doing?
2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
3. What are your assumptions about the value of `i`?

### PAUSE 2
Fix the code so that the print statement executes.
