You can define global constants in your code file for easy access. Their job is meant to be "set and forget" so you can use their values but never need to mofy them. 

### Naming Convention
Global constants are normally declared in ALL_CAPS with a underscore in between.

e.g.

```
PI = 3.14159
GOOGLE_URL = "https://www.google.com"
```
